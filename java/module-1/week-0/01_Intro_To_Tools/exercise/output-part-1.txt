 You still need to make a few more changes.
 If you are having difficulty troubleshooting, try the following:
 - Use 'pwd' to print out your current working directory.
 - Check for typos in the names of folders or file paths.
 - When changing directories, '..' means up one directory. '.' means the current directory.
 - Reference Finder (Mac) or Explorer (PC) to make sure everything is in the correct location.
